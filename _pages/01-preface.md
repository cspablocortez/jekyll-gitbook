This book *covers* (in the broadest sense of the term) the 
topic of *web development* (in the broadest sense of the 
term).[^1] 
It has been adapted from lectures taught over 
more 
than five years to students with various expertise levels 
and interests. These interests, ranging from game 
development to math, art and science converge upon a single 
point &mdash;shareablity.

Software development is rarely carried out in isolated 
environments for single-use; it aims to be accessible, 
distributable, and scalable: modern software wants to be 
*universal*. This goal has been consistently pursued through 
various technologies that together comprise the vast, 
fractured toolset of web development technogies, and each of 
these addresses a domain that falls under the umbrella term 
of **web development**.

This book is a field guide[^2] to these technologies, 
supplemented with examples to give them historical, social, 
and philosophical context. Some materials in this book have 
been beeen sourced and adapted from open source projects, 
all of which are credited in corresponding sections.

[^1]: I adopt a variation of John Searle's definition of *philosophy*: "Philosophy is the attempt to understand how things in the broadest sense of the term hang together in the broadest sense of the term"

[^2]: Frances Mayes defines a field guide as "an *aide-memoire* as well as a taxonomic treasure and a source of new information."
