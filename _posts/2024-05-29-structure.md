Each entry in the Field Guide can be read independently as a reference article. 
Entries are neither exhaustive nor comprehensive treatises on a given topic.
Instead they'll provide supplementary materials to help the reader recognize 
relationships between various concepts through a project-based approach. 

## Introduction

The introduction of this book asks basic questions from the reader, such as:

- Why do you want to learn web development?
- What kind of projects do you want to build?
- What expectations do you have?

## Frontend Development

The first section covers what is commonly referred to as frontend technologies.[^1] 
We will look at HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and some frameworks and tooling, aligning
ourselves with the Mozilla Developer Network's ["Getting started with the web"](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web) series of coding guides and [The Odin Project](https://theodinproject.com), an open-source curriculum for learning web development.
